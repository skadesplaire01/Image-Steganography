#Image Steganography – Hide Secret Messages in Images

📌 Overview
This project implements image steganography, a technique for hiding secret messages inside an image without altering its visible appearance. It ensures secure and covert communication by embedding text into image pixels using Python.

🚀 Features
✅ Invisible Message Embedding – Secret text is hidden without noticeable image changes.

✅ Password Protection – Only authorized users can retrieve the hidden message.

✅ Lightweight & Efficient – Uses basic Python libraries without additional dependencies.

✅ User-Friendly – Simple encryption and decryption process.

🛠️ Technology Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy

Platform: Google Colab 

🎯 How It Works?

🔹 Encryption (Hiding Message in Image)

1️⃣ Upload an image.

2️⃣ Enter the secret message and password.

3️⃣ The message is embedded in the image pixels.

4️⃣ Save and share the encrypted image.

🔹 Decryption (Extracting Hidden Message)

1️⃣ Load the encrypted image.

2️⃣ Enter the correct password.

3️⃣ Retrieve the hidden message.
